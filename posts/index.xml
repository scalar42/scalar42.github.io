However, when it comes to English literature and academic writing, the situation is rather different. As a result of my study and talks with others (primarily researchers), I have compiled this list of books that meet my needs. I&amp;rsquo;ve read some of the books on this list, and I&amp;rsquo;m presently reading others. I&amp;rsquo;ve made this list available in case anybody else has comparable requirements to mine, and I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you could add or amend anything you find.</description></item></channel></rss>
