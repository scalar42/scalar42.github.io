It is not that demanding for non-native English speakers to learn how to write in the language. However, when it comes to English literature and academic writing, the situation is rather different. As a result of my study and talks with others (primarily researchers), I have compiled this list of books that meet my needs. I've read some of the books on this list, and I'm presently reading others. I've made this list available in case anybody else has comparable requirements to mine, and I'd appreciate it if you could add or amend anything you find.
